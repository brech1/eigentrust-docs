description: What is reputation?

# Introduction

"Reputation" by Google's definition:\
\- _the beliefs or opinions that are generally held about someone or something._\
__\
__To expand on that: Opinion established toward a person or a thing based on its previous actions or performance.

Eigen Trust tries to represent that inside a p2p protocol. There are several characteristics a protocol should have in order to properly represent that:\
\- Peers opinion about someone should be weighted by their own opinion, meaning opinions from peers that have high reputation is more valued than the one with low reputation.\
\- Privacy - A peers reputation should only be known by the peer themselves.\
\- Domains - Reputation can be applied in multiple domains. The domains can be closely associated or not.\
\- Decay - Without doing these actions the reputation is associated with, the reputation should decay over time.



What Eigen Trust also tries to achieve is **decentralization**. The reputation is calculated collectively by the peers, instead of relying on one computer.
