# Domains

* Why domains exist - what kind of domains exist
* Domain aggregation
* Special domain for managers and root domain

### Why domains exist?

Encapsulating someones reputation from all field into one number would be incorrect. If you earn your reputation as a software developer, that reputation should not be used in a context of community building. Each of these should be seen as a separate domains, and they should be completely separated from the others, but at the same time be part of the same more broader domain.

### Domain aggregation

TBA

### Special domain for managers

Managers should earn reputation is specially reserved domain. This domain should be direct child of the root domain.
